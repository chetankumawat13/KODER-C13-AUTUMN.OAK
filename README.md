# 🍂 Autumn Oak — Animated Landing Page

Autumn Oak is a modern, stylish, and fully animated landing page created for a wine brand. The main idea behind this project is to mix storytelling with design and interactivity. It’s not just a static website — sometimes it simply plays with animations, scroll effects, and smooth interactions to create a premium experience for the user. Built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, enhanced by **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** and **Lenis (Smooth Scroll Library)**, this project demonstrates how animations and creative UI design can bring a brand to life on the web.

The landing page starts with a **hero section** that tells the Autumn Oak brand story, showcasing a bold headline with a wine bottle image. As the user scrolls, **Lenis smooth scrolling** ensures a clean, fluid experience, while **GSAP animations** trigger elegant transitions on text, images, and product cards. The design has been carefully styled with custom fonts, soft color palettes, and responsive layouts, making sure it looks beautiful on both desktop and mobile screens.

I’ve launched it live for everyone to check out:  
**Live Demo** → [Autumn Oak on GitHub Pages](https://chetankumawat13.github.io/KODER-C13-AUTUMN.OAK/)  
*(Works amazing — smooth animations and layout just like intended!)*

The project is cleanly structured: `index.html` contains the structure, `style.css` handles styling, fonts, and layout, and `app.js` powers animations and interactivity. The `asists/` folder houses images, logos, and other assets, keeping everything neat and maintainable.
